#UX

**Aim:** <br>
To get updated with the lastest news from choosen countries and within six categories.

**Target audience:**<br>
The user who is interested in latest news from *Country* within *Category*.<br>
The *Country* user can choose among:
- Sweden as default country, 
- Poland, 
- United Kingdom (named England here)
- Ireland
- France

The list of the countries is a subject to be extented. <br>

There are six categories for each *Country* to choose from: 
- Business
- Entertainment
- Health
- Science
- Sports
- Technology
- Latest news which is the section for all news from certain country.

**The user path:** <br>
The default settings while opening the webpage is:
- *Country*: *Sweden*
- *Category*: *Latest news* (all categories for *Country*) dispalyed.<br>

By default clicling on any *Country* only (without selecting *Category*) it will open the *Latest news* section.<br>

The user must scroll down to read the news.<br>

The user can be back to the top of the webpage either:
- by clicking on any *Country*
- by clicking on any *Category*
- by clicking on a *Go up* button on the right bottom of the webpage

**Optional paths:** <br>

The user can click on:

- *Country* to see *Latest news* from for example *Poland* and/or choose *Category* for example *Science*<br>
- Then staying within the *Catogory* *Science* the user can change the *Country* for Sweden and he will stay within the same *Category* (just different *Country*)
- To be back to the *Lastest News* for *Country* the user can click on *Lastest News* section
